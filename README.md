- 👋 Hi, I’m giel  @gielbloks
- 👀 I’m interested in reprap/marlin 2.09and up 11 axis 3d print/cnc firmware
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to create interpolation algorithms for 11 axis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on faster accurate 3d printing and cnc milling and one nozzle 
     Final target is 0.5 kg to 1kg a minute. done a lot of trial and error on frame
     Design and rigidity moving at meters/ second not mm's and a lot of experience to share on
     This part of the build still on a reasonable budget it works a lot with counter balancing
     Vibrations in the axis and eventually the printhead and milling head


Having a background as a cnc CADCAM programmer and operator gives me a lot of knowledge to slice a 
model in more than 3 axis that's the easy part for me. In cnc milling 5 axis simultaneously movement 
operating is becoming a standard but getting everything out of it is the hardest part. 
Like to challenge myself!!
